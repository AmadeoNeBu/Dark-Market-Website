# Dark-Market-Website
I have created a website structure using HTML and CSS. It was created after taking a short course in HTML and CSS, so it's not very interactive yet.

Update (09/02/2023): I am using relative links so it's easy to open the project.

Update (12/06/2023): Since I have learned JS, I have implemented the "Pocoyo Mode", which changes the adult content images into Pocoyo images by accessing to the DOM. Also, I put a button to close the pop-up.
